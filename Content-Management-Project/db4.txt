The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has seen Beta Pictoris as never before, capturing a previously unseen structure that gives the young planetary system a dusty cat's tail.

Located 63 light-years away, from us Beta Pictoris is a star around twice the size of the sun and eight times as bright, surrounded by a disk of gas and dust in which there is evidence planets have formed. 

Beta Pictoris was the first planetary system around which astronomers spotted a dusty disk of material composed of debris caused by the collision of asteroids and planetesimals during the system's violent formative years. Following this, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers spotted a second disk of debris and material in the Beta Pictoris system.

Now using JWST instruments — the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) — a team of astronomers has discovered another layer of structure in the system, in the form of a sharply inclined branch of dust extending from the southwest portion of the secondary debris disk.

"Beta Pictoris is the debris disk that has it all: It has a really bright, close star that we can study very well," study team leader Isabel Rebollido, a scientist at the Astrobiology Center in Spain, said in a statement. 

"While there have been previous observations from the ground in this wavelength range, they did not have the sensitivity and the spatial resolution that we now have with the JWST, so they didn’t detect this feature," Rebollido added.

The cat's tail of Beta Pictoris only appeared to the MIRI instrument because it is shining most brightly in mid-infrared  light, perhaps also explaining why it had been missed before.

Rebollido and her team also noticed another feature of Beta Pictoris. They saw a temperature difference between the two disks of the planetary system, which indicates they may have different compositions.

"We didn’t expect the JWST to reveal that there are two different types of material around Beta Pictoris, but MIRI clearly showed us that the material of the secondary disc and cat's tail is hotter than the main disc," research co-author Christopher Stark, of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, said in the same statement. "The dust that forms that disc and tail must be very dark, so we don't easily see it at visible or near-infrared wavelengths — but in the mid-infrared, it's glowing."

The team theorizes that the disk with the hotter temperature is comprised of dark, highly porous material that is similar to that seen at the surface of comets and asteroids in our solar system, which is known as "organic refractory material."

Newfound Earth-size exoplanet has a scorching-hot lava side

NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has discovered an extraordinary planet that's roughly the size of Earth but is only one-tenth of our planet's age, with half of its surface likely dominated by scorching-hot lava. 

The exoplanet orbits a sun-like star called HD 63433, which is located 73 light-years from Earth, at a proximity of around 12% the distance between Mercury and the sun. This is so close that the planet, designated HD 63433 d, completes an orbit in just 4.2 Earth days. 

Because of this proximity to its star, which has 99% the mass of our sun, the planet is tidally locked, just like the moon is to Earth. This means that one side of the planet, its dayside, constantly faces the star and is permanently blasted with stellar radiation while the cooler nightside perpetually faces out into space. This pushes surface temperatures on the planet's dayside  up around 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit (1,260 degrees Celsius), NASA officials said.

The violent temperatures of HD 63433 d mean that the planet's dayside is likely a hemisphere of blisteringly hot lava resembling that of exoplanets like CoRoT-7 b and Kepler-10 b.

However, this exoplanet is also remarkable for a slightly less extreme reason than its lava-dominated dayside. 

HD 63433 d is also the smallest confirmed exoplanet that's less than 500 million years old. In addition to this, at 1.1 times the diameter of our planet, HD 63433 d is the closest roughly Earth-size planet to be discovered that is less than 400 million years old.

For comparison: Earth and the rest of our solar system are around 4.5 billion years old, meaning HD 63433 d appears to be just around 10% of the age of our planet. 

The Earth-orbiting TESS discovered HD 63433 d as it crossed, or "transited," the face of its star, causing a slight dip in light from its stellar parent. 

TESS, which launched in April 2018, has used this transit method of exoplanet detection to spot over 4,000 alien worlds, of which several hundred have been confirmed. 

This isn't the first planet to be discovered orbiting HD 63433; the existence of sibling worlds prompted further investigation of the system. In 2020, the transit method uncovered HD 63433 b and HD 63433 c. The former is a roughly Neptune-size planet around 2.1 times wider than Earth and roughly five times more massive. HD 63433 b orbits its star at 0.07 times the distance between Earth and the sun, with a year that lasts 7.1 Earth days.

HD 63433 c is slightly larger, around 0.23 times the size of Jupiter, with a mass around seven times that of Earth. This world takes a relatively leisurely orbit of 20.5 Earth days around its star, dwelling at a distance 0.14 times that between Earth and the sun.

The unique features of HD 63433 make it a primary target for subsequent investigations that will aim to further study both the day and night hemispheres of this world. 

The discovery of HD 63433 d was discussed on Wednesday (Jan. 10) at the 2024 American Astronomical Society Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana, and is detailed in a paper published that same day in The Astronomical Journal.

A fresh preview for the first epic sci-fi series of 2024 just warmed the hearts and minds of sci-fi faithful across the globe with the release of a fantastic full trailer for Netflix's "3 Body Problem," a compelling eight-episode alien invasion saga that strikes the streaming giant this spring.

With a sterling production pedigree featuring "Game of Thrones'" Emmy Award-winning creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss alongside the Emmy-nominated Alexander Woo ("The Terror: Infamy," "True Blood"), this provocative and terrifying tale is adapted from the trilogy of science fiction novels known as "The Three-Body Problem," by bestselling Chinese author Cixin Liu.

Here's the official synopsis:

"The story begins in 1960s China when a young woman makes a fateful decision that reverberates across space and time into the present day. When the laws of nature as we know them inexplicably unravel, a tight-knit group of brilliant scientists must join forces with an unflinching detective to stop humanity's greatest threat. '3 Body Problem' is an epic story that redefines sci-fi drama with its layered mysteries and genre-bending high stakes."

As expected from the showrunners of HBO's "Game of Thrones," "3 Body Problem's" exceptional ensemble cast includes several familiar faces from the fantasy realm of The Seven Kingdoms, including Liam Cunningham, Jonathan Pryce, and John Bradley. This engaging trio is fortified by a range of intense performances from Jess Hong, Eiza González, Jovan Adepo, Benedict Wong, Alex Sharp, Rosalind Chao, Marlo Kelly, Sea Shimooka, Zine Tseng and Saamer Usmani.

With its sci-fi mystery vibes that evoke memories of other classic series like Netflix's "Dark" and "1899" and Prime Video's "The Peripheral," the time-twisting narrative involves a fictional past, present and future Earth invaded by an extraterrestrial civilization that resides in a solar system of three stars orbiting around each other. 

The series title refers to a scientific term of orbital mechanics in the field of astrodynamics wherein three heavenly bodies exist in a gravitational relationship.

Astronomers accidentally discover 'dark' primordial galaxy with no visible stars

Astronomers have accidentally discovered a dark galaxy filled with primordial gas untouched that appears to have no visible stars. 

The researchers behind the discovery say this galaxy, designated J0613+52, could be "the faintest galaxy found to date." Interestingly, scientists using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) discovered the "dark" galaxy through a complete error. 

"The GBT was accidentally pointed to the wrong coordinates and found this object. It's a galaxy made only out of gas — it has no visible stars," Green Bank Observatory senior scientist Karen O'Neil said in a statement. "Stars could be there. We just can't see them."

Remarkably, this galaxy full of primordial gas isn't billions of light-years away and thus seen as it was when the 13.8 billion-year-old universe was in its infancy; instead, the dark galaxy designated J0613+52 is just around 270 million light-years away. 

Low Surface Brightness galaxies
J0613+52 was discovered by astronomers as they surveyed hydrogen gas in several so-called Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies using several major radio telescopes around the globe, including the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the world's largest fully steerable radio telescope located in Green Bank, West Virginia, and the Nançay Radio Telescope at the Paris Observatory.

LSBs tend to have a tiny population of stars spread across their volume, and as a result, they emit much less light per unit of area than standard galaxies like the Milky Way or Andromeda. LSBs are often barely brighter than the background luminosity of the night sky, making them incredibly tough to spot.

For instance, the first LSB to be discovered was Malin 1, found in the 1980s, which is still one of the largest spiral galaxies ever seen at 5 times the width of the Milky Way. Despite its size, though, Malin 1 is just 1% as bright as our galaxy.

LSBs also seem to be evolving much more slowly than other galaxies, with many still experiencing early stages of star formation. Astronomers believe this is because of their low gas density, meaning that overdense clumps of gas can't coalesce to that eventually birth stars.

The aim of the survey that found J0613+52 was to determine the mass and gas content of these low-brightness or "ultra-diffuse" galaxies, the diluted nature of which causes issues for current theories of star formation and galactic evolution. Astronomers noticed a disparity in data between the GBT and the Nançay Radio Telescope that would lead to the discovery of a galaxy that is an LSB unlike any other in the LSB survey.

January's new moon welcomes Mercury as a 'morning star'

The new moon of January will be at 6:57 a.m. Eastern Time on January 11, according to the U.S. Naval Observatory, and a day later the planet Mercury will reach its greatest westward separation from the sun, showing itself as a "morning star." 

New moons happen when the sun and moon share the same celestial longitude, a position also called conjunction. At new phase, you can't see the moon from Earth because the illuminated side is facing away from us. 

New moons are only visible during solar eclipses; The only way to see the new moon is when it passes in front of the sun, causing a solar eclipse, which isn't happening this month (the next one is slated for April 8).

Visible Planets

The day after the new moon (Jan. 12), the sun rises at 7:19 a.m. Eastern Time in New York. Mercury rises at 5:40 a.m., so by 7 a.m. it will be about 12 degrees high in the southeast. The planet reaches greatest western elongation that afternoon at 2:18 p.m., according to skywatching site In-the-Sky.org. Mercury will still be hard to see, but one can use Venus, which will be about 19 degrees high, to find it. 

Venus is the single brightest star-like object in the sky, and it will be above and to the right of Mercury, which is fainter and only just visible as the sky starts to get light. One should try to spot Mercury as soon as possible after it rises, since the brightening sky will make it harder to see as sunrise approaches.

As one goes southwards the observing prospects for Mercury improve because the angle of Mercury's orbit (as viewed from Earth) with the horizon gets steeper. If one is in Miami, for example, Mercury rises at 5:29 a.m. and by sunrise, which is at 7:09 a.m., Mercury is a full 18 degrees high. The innermost planet won't be visible at that point as the sky is too bright, but by 6:30 a.m. it will be about 12 degrees above the southeastern horizon. 

The best observing prospects are near the equator. In Quito, sunrise on Jan 12 is at 6:15 a.m. and Mercury rises at 4:38 a.m. local time. By sunrise it is a full 23 degrees high in the southeast, and a half hour before sunrise at 5:45 a.m. Mercury is 15 degrees high. As one moves into the Southern Hemisphere the planet's elevation will decrease again; in Buenos Aires, the planet rises at 4:13 a.m., with sunrise at 5:53 a.m. A half hour before sunrise the planet is about 12 degrees high in the southeast; as in the Northern Hemisphere one can use Venus to find Mercury; Venus, about 22 degrees above the eastern horizon, will be above and to the left of Mercury.  

On the day of the new moon, Venus is still a bright morning star, and when the moon is not out it is the last celestial object one can see with the naked eye; it is a distinct, bright star even relatively close to sunrise. Venus rises at 4:45 a.m. on Jan. 11 in New York, with sunrise at 6:49 a.m. By sunrise the planet's altitude is 17 degrees.

'Missing link' supernova connects star's death to birth of black hole or neutron star

Astronomers have discovered the stellar "missing link" that directly connects a massive star's death to the birth of a black hole or a neutron star.

Two teams of scientists made the discovery using the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the New Technology Telescope (NTT) to look at supernova wreckage designated SN 2022jli, which was discovered in May 2022. Lurking in the spiral arm of the relatively close galaxy NGC 157, located 75 million light-years away from Earth, SN 2022jli demonstrated peculiar traits distinguishing it from other supernovas.

While most supernovas simply fade in brightness after the initial explosion that marks the death of a star that has run out of fuel for nuclear fusion at its core, SN 2022jli's brightness declines regularly, but not smoothly, instead "jumping" up and down every 12 Earth days or so. 

This light oscillation appears to be the result of a black hole or neutron star whipping through the puffed-out atmosphere of a surviving star among the gas cloud supernova wreckage, stealing matter as it does so.

Related: Star-birthing galaxies can hide supermassive black holes behind walls of dust

"In SN 2022jli's data, we see a repeating sequence of brightening and fading," study leader and Queen's University Belfast scientist Thomas Moore said in a statement. "This is the first time that repeated periodic oscillations, over many cycles, have been detected in a supernova light curve."

Astronomers have previously spotted indirect evidence of the link between destroyed massive stars and super-dense stellar remnants like neutron stars and black holes. One such example is the presence of a neutron star at the heart of supernova wreckage called the Crab Nebula, created when a star exploded nearly a thousand years ago. 

However, this new research is the first direct evidence of a connection between supernovas and black holes or neutron stars.

The discovery was presented at the 243rd American Astronomical Society meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday, Jan. 9, by the leader of one of the teams of astronomers, Weizmann Institute of Science researcher Ping Chen.

Companion star is a witness to a massive star murder mystery
Both teams of scientists behind the observations of  SN 2022jli think that the strange oscillating brightness behavior of this supernova happens as a result of a companion star existing alongside the exploded massive star, making this a binary star system.

While binary star systems are not exceptional, especially for massive stars, what makes this system really special is the fact that the supernova death of the system's massive star hasn't kicked away or destroyed its companion star and that the two objects remain in orbit around each other. 

Using the X-shooter instrument on the VLT and a variety of other astronomical instruments, the team led by Chen made additional observations as well as spotting the regular fluctuations in the visible brightness of SN 2022jli. This led to them also seeing periodic movements in hydrogen gas in the system and powerful bursts of high-energy light called gamma rays.

When all this evidence is combined, it suggested to the two research teams that when the system's companion star interacted with the material blasted out by the supernova death of its stellar sibling, the hydrogen envelope of the surviving star "puffed out."

The black hole or neutron star in SN 2022jli  is passing through this swelled-out layer, pulling away material with its gravitational influence. This material formed a disk of matter around the compact stellar remnant and the snatching process is releasing energy responsible for the periodic flashes in brightness observed by the two teams.

For the researchers, this theft of matter and energy from the companion star confirms the presence of a neutron star or black hole that is attracting matter to itself, even though this dense stellar remnant can't be seen directly. 

"Our research is like solving a puzzle by gathering all possible evidence. All these pieces lining up lead to the truth," Chen concluded.

Massive Mars dust storm spotted by China's Tianwen-1 probe

China's Tianwen-1 orbiter spotted a massive dust storm on Mars near Olympus Mons, the biggest mountain in the solar system.

The massive dust storm was captured by the medium-resolution MoRIC camera on Tianwen-1 in January 2022. The mission launched in July 2020 and arrived in orbit around Mars just ahead of the arrival of NASA's Perseverance rover in February 2021. 

An image of the storm was processed by Andrea Luck, using data from China's Lunar and Planetary Data Release System. Luck then shared the images on X. A larger version is viewable on Flickr.

A Chinese research team is developing methods to identify and assess sand and dust storms using MoRIC images, according to a journal article published in October last year.

Luck also processed a striking crescent Mars image of what is apparently the same storm near Olympus Mons, making the most of the fact there are several active orbiters around Mars. The image this time came from the UAE's Hope Mars mission probe.

The Tianwen-1 mission also included the solar-powered Zhurong rover. Its successful landing made China only the second country to operate a rover on the Red Planet. 

Zhurong completed its primary mission and went on to conduct extended exploration activities in the large plain of Utopia Planitia. It entered hibernation in May 2022 and was expected to reawaken in December that year. 

However, China has been unable to make contact with the rover since its hibernation. It is thought that the vehicle's solar arrays became covered with more Martian dust than expected, rendering it unable to generate the power necessary to reactivate.

SETI scientists begin huge new hunt for intelligent aliens

Keith Cooper

https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uMHimeHetVYcCSt8ExUM8-650-80.jpg.webp

The search for alien technosignatures has dramatically expanded, thanks to a new experiment involving an alliance between the SETI Institute, Breakthrough Listen and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

The new project is called COSMIC ("Commensal Open-Source Multimode Interferometer Cluster") and is in operation at the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) of radio telescopes in New Mexico. The VLA was featured in Robert Zemeckis' 1997 movie "Contact," starring Jodie Foster and based on Carl Sagan's famous novel of the same name.

COSMIC makes this possible and delivers a huge jump in coverage. Whereas previous SETI surveys have only been able to scrutinize a few thousand stars, COSMIC on the VLA will listen in on hundreds of thousands, and potentially millions, of star systems at frequencies between 0.75 and 50 GHz. It will enable a detailed SETI search of 80% of the entire sky (from declinations of -40 degrees to the zenith), which is orders of magnitude more in depth than all previous SETI searches combined.

"Currently the focus is on creating one of the largest surveys for technological signals, with over 500,000 sources observed in the first six months," said COSMIC project scientist Chenoa Tremblay, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, in a press statement. Currently, COSMIC is scanning cosmic radio sources at a rate of about 2,000 per hour.

COSMIC is able to piggyback on the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), which commenced its third observing run back in January 2023. COSMIC receives a copy of the raw data collected by the 27-dish radio array, before the VLA does any automated, standard processing to it. This allows SETI scientists to process the data however they want to, and in real time, too. 

This rapid analysis is crucial. Often, SETI searches have detected interesting narrowband signals, but they are not noticed until weeks or months later when the data is analyzed. Often, when astronomers go for a second look, the signal has vanished, so there's no way to know if it was a real E.T. signal or, more likely, radio frequency interference (RFI) from human activities on (or in orbit around) Earth. Bona fide ET signals could be brief bursts and require quick identification and follow up.

Speaking of rapid signals, COSMIC has extremely high time sensitivity; it's able to detect radio signals as short as nanoseconds. Again, this is an important ability to have. Transmitting across interstellar distances is not cheap: in terms of power output, the energy resources required to maintain an omnidirectional transmission across hours, days, months or years that can be detected dozens or even hundreds or thousands of light-years away is immense. More cost-effective would be for aliens to beam nanosecond pulses that hit Earth for a short time before moving on to other planetary systems, and then cycle back to Earth. Many previous SETI radio searches, however, have not had integration times short enough to detect these nanosecond, or even millisecond, pulses.

The COSMIC system has also been designed with the future in mind, by leaving room for upgrades that can keep it at the peak of SETI experimentation. For example, the number of targets that can be simultaneously observed could be increased, and machine-learning algorithms introduced to analyze the data even more assiduously.

Nearby exoplanet may be rich in life-giving water

An exoplanet orbiting a small star some 50 light-years away from Earth may be a life-friendly water world, a new study has revealed — and the James Webb Space Telescope could determine if that is indeed the case.

The planet in question, called LHS 1140b, orbits in the habitable zone of a small, dim star called LHS 1140 that lies in the constellation Cetus. The exoplanet was discovered in 2017 and has been observed by multiple telescopes since. 

These observations first convinced researchers that LHS 1140b is a rocky planet about 1.7 times wider than Earth. But a new analysis of all available observations has shown that LHS 1140b is not dense enough to be purely rocky and must either contain much more water than Earth or possess an extensive atmosphere full of light elements such as hydrogen and helium.

Researchers can't yet tell which of the two options is correct, but the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) might be able to find out in the coming years. If LHS 1140b is a water world, then the planet is set to become the number one target in the search for life outside our solar system.

"Since the planet is in the habitable zone, it's really interesting, because if you had water on the surface of a planet inside the habitable zone, you would expect that some of the water is in the liquid state," Charles Cadieux, an astronomy researcher at the University of Montreal and lead author of the new study, told Space.com. "So that's a really interesting scenario in terms of habitability."

Since the first-ever discovery of an exoplanet in 1992, astronomers have confirmed more than 5,500 worlds orbiting stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Of those known exoplanets, however, only a handful are potentially habitable, said Cadieux. 

For years, the most promising target to search for extrasolar life has been the intriguing system around a small, red star called TRAPPIST-1. A little closer to Earth than LHS 1140, TRAPPIST-1 hosts an impressive collection of seven known Earth-size exoplanets, three of which circle in the star in its habitable zone. But recent observations by JWST have been turning out disappointing results, suggesting that those planets might be completely barren with no atmosphere and no surface water. That, Cadieux said, is not entirely surprising. 

"We know that the TRAPPIST-1 star is very active," Cadieux said. "It produces many flares. And the current observations with Webb suggest that these planets may be just balls of rock with no atmosphere and probably no life at all because the star is too active, and all the atmospheres have been stripped off."

SpaceX's new direct-to-cell Starlink satellites relay their 1st text messages

Mike wall

Well, that was fast.

SpaceX just broke in its new direct-to-cell Starlink satellites, using one of them to send text messages for the first time. 

The milestone came on Jan. 8, just six days after the six Starlink spacecraft launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base, the company announced in an update on Wednesday (Jan. 10).

Those pioneering texts included the classic "New phone who dis?" as well as "Never had such signal" and "Much wow," according to a SpaceX post on X on Wednesday. (SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk said the first message was "LFGMF2024," but he was apparently joking.) 

Starlink is SpaceX's satellite network in low Earth orbit that provides internet service to people around the world. 

The megaconstellation currently consists of more than 5,250 functional spacecraft, but the six that went up on Jan. 2 were the first with direct-to-cell capabilities. (Those half-dozen launched along with 15 traditional Starlink satellites.)

Beaming connectivity service from satellites directly to smartphones — which SpaceX is doing via a partnership with T-Mobile — is a difficult proposition, as SpaceX noted in Wednesday's update.

"For example, in terrestrial networks cell towers are stationary, but in a satellite network they move at tens of thousands of miles per hour relative to users on Earth," SpaceX wrote. "This requires seamless handoffs between satellites and accommodations for factors like Doppler shift and timing delays that challenge phone-to-space communications. Cell phones are also incredibly difficult to connect to satellites hundreds of kilometers away, given a mobile phone's low antenna gain and transmit power."

The direct-to-cell Starlink satellites overcome these challenges thanks to "innovative new custom silicon, phased-array antennas and advanced software algorithms," SpaceX added.

Overcoming tough challenges can lead to great rewards, and that's the case here, according to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell

"Satellite connectivity direct to cell phones will have a tremendous impact around the world, helping people communicate wherever and whenever they want or need to," Shotwell said via X on Wednesday.

The Jan. 2 Starlink launch was SpaceX's first of the year. But there will be many more: The company has said it aims to launch 144 orbital missions in 2024, which would break its record of 98, set last year.

Editor's note: This story was updated at 6:10 p.m. EST on Jan. 11 to include some of the first texts sent via the direct-to-cell Starlink satellites.
