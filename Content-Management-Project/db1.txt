Trying and searching and wanting

I am sitting on my balcony. It is spring and there is a little bit of heat in the sun. The balcony looks out over a road. The road is usually busy… an endless stream of trucks and cars but right now there is no traffic. Everyone is self-isolating. The machine has stopped. It feels strange. Peaceful. I can hear different birds… the wren, the blackbird, the robin. A blue tit is flitting from one branch to the next. Life goes on. I could sit here all day.

“Don’t try”. Those are the two simple words of advice offered by the poet Charles Bukowski.
It jars for most people to receive that advice… especially those of us who want a better world.
I have been stuck in a cycle of “trying” for a while now and I see a lot of it in the world

Trying and searching and wanting.
Everywhere I look people, including me, are rushing to the next moment.
I know that 99% of people probably won’t resonate with what I’m going to say. They might think that I’m an idiot and that this piece is a cop out.
Not trying is seen as the “worst”.

It means that you are lazy and you don’t care.
It means that you settle.
It means that you do nothing.
It means that you are part of the problem.
It means that you are helpless.

Is that really true?
I don’t think so.

Does the oak tree try?
No. It just is.

Does the oak tree do nothing?
No. It just is.

Why is it that we humans are always trying and searching and wanting?
Don’t rush. Close your eyes and sit with that question for a moment.
Why are you always trying and searching and wanting?
I just sat with it and here’s what I feel.
Maybe you feel differently and that’s ok.
I try and search and want because at the root of it there is a sense that the present moment, “now”, is not ok.
There is an underlying restlessness and there is self-centred narcissism that always want’s more.
More knowledge.
More impact.
More acknowledgement.
More people agreeing with me.
More people telling me I’m great.
More distraction.
More security.
This is hard for me to admit but if I’m honest whenever I “try and search and want”, nothing I do is truly selfless.
There is no love.
There is always a hidden self-centred motivation. I am part of the problem.
It’s funny because when I don’t try. When I am truly open and aware and responsive, everything I do is selfless.
I just do it.

Slow down.
Let go.
Surrender.
Just take a breath.
Open to this moment as it is.
You are alive.
Don’t try to be present.
Don’t try to still your mind.
Don’t try to change anything.

What does it feel like when you stop rushing to the next moment?
Allow this moment to be ok, as it is.
Don’t just read these words.
Look away from the screen for a moment and see for yourself.

What do you feel?
Maybe you feel numb at first?
Maybe you feel more?
Maybe you feel sadness?
A lump in your throat?
Maybe there is also a feeling of peace and openness and release?
Maybe you feel insecure and anxious?
Maybe there is love?
Right now can you just sit with what is?
To me it feels like a fist that has been tightly clenched for a long time, slowly opening and softening.
Maybe, sometimes, something new emerges?
A new way of seeing things.
An insight.
Clarity.
Wise action.
You can’t try to make something new emerge though!
I always fall back into that trap.
Always trying.
That’s what Bukowski meant.
Get out of the way and stop trying.

Maybe that’s what the world needs right now?

I have a feeling that if there was less trying and searching and wanting the more beautiful world we imagine would emerge by itself.

Connecting to Care

https://natureinmind.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/IMG_0242-600x400.jpg

The absence of a deep emotional connection between humans and the natural world is at the root of the environmental crisis.

Can you think of a place in nature that you know really well?
Close your eyes for a moment and see what comes up.

Can you visualise the place in exquisite detail? The sounds, the colours, the smells, the subtleties that only you know.
Do memories surface? Perhaps you have known this place for a long time. Maybe you spent golden moments from your childhood here? There might be happy memories tinged with sadness or regret?

How does it feel when you bring this place to mind now?
Please don’t rush. Take a moment to connect.

Now another question.

How would you feel if this same place was under imminent threat? Imagine someone is destroying it right now. What do you feel? Anger? Sadness? Shock? Resignation? Nothing at all?

Can you imagine that you might actually do something immediate and tangible to help protect this place?

Be honest with yourself.

If you really have a deep connection with this place, it is likely that you might feel moved to do something. That’s obvious, right? We naturally and instinctively act to protect that which we care very deeply about.

But what if that deep connection with a place is absent? How would that affect your response? It’s a beautiful place but it’s not your place. Are you still likely to do something about it? Is it your responsibility?

Let me paint two scenarios for you…

You are walking through town at night and you see your best friend looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. You haven’t seen him for six months. There is probably an initial shock: “Oh my God, what happened?!!” You instinctively reach out for him. Before you know it your arm is on his shoulder: “Come home with me. Let me take care of you”.

Now another night. This time you see a random stranger looking dishevelled, sleeping rough on the street. Be honest. What do you do? Is it someone else’s problem? If your heart is big enough you might give him some money or buy him a sandwich but is he coming home to sleep on your couch? Perhaps you rationalise your inaction by reminding yourself that you donate to the local homeless charity. You might remind yourself to vote for a politician who appears committed to doing something. But most of the time most of us don’t do anything at all.

Why the difference? It’s obvious isn’t it… in the first scenario you don’t even think. You have a deep emotional connection with your best friend and you have to act. In the second scenario you might feel sad and you might recognise the tragedy of the situation but there is no emotional connection between the two of you, so more often than not you don’t act.

John Steinbeck put it very well when he wrote (at a time when there was famine in China): “It means very little to know that a million Chinese are starving unless you know one Chinese who is starving.” There needs to be an emotional connection for the thing to have any meaning.

It is the very same when it comes to the environmental crisis. There is a groundswell of support at the moment for taking steps to avert climate change. The reality that there is a problem seems to have finally dawned on a lot of people. But still most people don’t really “do” anything significant do they? I’m not being self-righteous or judgemental here. I know that I’m guilty of it myself. Why are we all so passive? Why do we wait for someone else to do something?

There are a number of reasons and it’s not simple (and I certainly don’t have the answer). I have thought about it a lot though and I have some ideas:

The sheer scale of the problem is so frightening, most of us don’t feel capable of doing anything meaningful. The tree is about to fall down and I am just a tiny ant!
Society as currently constructed is designed to make us passive and docile. We lead incredibly busy lives… commute, work, eat, exercise, shop, look after the kids, more work, Netflix, bed. Most of us just sleepwalk through life on automatic pilot waiting for the next brief window of pleasure. One day blending into the next. We have hardly any time to reflect, let alone act.
Many in society feel socially isolated. The sense of community has broken down. Loneliness is an epidemic at the moment. If you feel like you are on your own, you are far less likely to summon up the courage to do something. The Titanic is sinking and you are just one person with a bucket. Everyone else on the boat is a stranger to you. What’s the point?
Perhaps the biggest reason we do nothing is that most of us have lost the sense of deep connection with the natural world that our ancestors took for granted. If you don’t feel deeply connected to nature, you obviously don’t care about it in the same way and you are far less likely to do something immediate and meaningful. It’s the same reason why you ignore the homeless person you don’t know.
So what can you do?

I don’t have the answer. It does however seem to me that passing various pieces of legislation, banning single use plastics and imposing carbon taxes is essentially treating the symptom and not the disease. Like an obese person with type 2 diabetes who goes to the doctor because he has high blood pressure and takes a tablet every day without fundamentally changing the way he lives his life, and more importantly changing his relationship with himself. I’m not saying that strong legislative action isn’t essential. It obviously is, but the root goes much deeper.

It is probably a good idea for you to start very small. You can do something and maybe others will follow. It’s also great if you don’t feel like you are on your own. Can you find and connect with a community of others who feel the same way as you? Here is a small example to show you what I’m talking about…

I live in an apartment complex in a suburb of Dublin. One day I saw one of the gardeners spraying the lawn with pesticides. He was wearing a mask because he didn’t want to ingest those chemicals himself. I spoke with him. He was a nice man, just doing his job. I could have left it there but I didn’t because I felt something… anger, sadness, defiance, some strength. Why is this happening to my place?! I put up a petition which was promptly taken down by the management company. But it was still seen and lo and behold, some other people who live here agreed that we should stop spraying the gardens where we live. So suddenly there is community. I’m not one person on a sinking ship with a bucket. There is some strength in numbers and there is the possibility of something positive happening. It’s a drop in the ocean but it counts.

Most importantly, to get to the root of this problem we need to rediscover the deeper connection with nature which we have lost. Mindfulness is one way of cultivating this connection. It takes time and patience. Two things in life which are in very short supply.

The Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh expressed it beautifully: “To know fully one field or one land is a lifetime’s experience. In the world of poetic experience it is depth that counts, not width. A gap in a hedge, a smooth rock surfacing a narrow lane, a view of woody meadows, the stream at the junction of four small fields – these are as much as any man can fully experience.”

Most of us have neither the time nor the inclination to pursue a deeper nature experience… for the masses it is width that counts, not depth. We are addicted to new experiences. Consuming new places in a very shallow and meaningless way. A nice photograph for Instagram and another place ticked off the list.

What about the places we habituate? The lane we pass on our way to work. The horse chestnut tree in the field overlooking the car park. The park where we walk the dog. The canal where we eat our lunch everyday.

Do you stop and listen to the trees stirring in the breeze? Do you notice the first leaves of spring and the very last leaves of winter? Do you know the call of each songbird? Have you noticed how the character of a place changes day by day and even moment by moment?

Can you slow down and pay attention in these moments?

It’s a drop in the ocean but it counts.

Society – The soil in which we grow

barryevan

https://natureinmind.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16-12-23-Wildflowers.jpg

In order for any plant to grow and flourish to its full potential, it needs the right conditions.

The soil is all important. Everything grows in the soil. If the soil is good and you have the right amount of sunshine and water everything takes care of itself. Nature follows its own course. We don’t need to interfere. The tiny acorn grows into the majestic Oak tree.

Would the same Oak tree grow in a desert? Would it flourish in a tiny plant pot? What if the soil is barren and polluted?

It is no different for human beings. In order for us to grow and flourish to our full potential, we need the right conditions. In our case, you could think of society as the soil in which we grow. What do I mean when I say “society”? I mean it in the broadest possible sense: our families, our communities, our schools, our friends, our government institutions, our laws, our offices, our work, our recreational spaces, our culture… the world in which we live.

Does our society provide the optimum conditions for human growth and development?

Is each person afforded the appropriate conditions which will allow them to flourish… to become what they were always naturally inclined to become: an artist, a farmer, a carer, an entertainer, a thinker, a writer, a scientist, a mother, a teacher, an explorer?

Is our society more akin to an industrial farm where only one or two crops are considered to be of value? Where rainforests are chopped down to make room for the profitable, consumable crops. Where any inclination towards being an artist or an explorer or a philosopher is suppressed in favour of something more practical… maybe an accountant or a tax consultant or a banker? Not that there’s anything at all wrong with those professions if that’s what you love to do. Does society make it easy for a person to discover what their talent is and does it enable them to cultivate that talent? Is that what school does or in a sense does our current education system do the exact opposite? Does it teach children to question and think for themselves or does it teach them to memorise facts and conform?

Think back to when you were very young. What did you love to do back then? What were you really interested in? Maybe it’s so long ago you find it difficult to remember. Did you have a natural inclination towards something? Were you one of the lucky ones and did you always follow this interest throughout your life or did you stop for some reason? Was it suppressed? When did it become very important to “fit in” and please other people? When did you become pragmatic? When did safety become the most important thing? When did earning lots of money, owning material things and being “successful” become the dream? What is success? Were you ever empowered to follow your real dream or did it always seem unrealistic and unfeasible to do that? Were you ever asked what it is you would really like to do with your life? Have you ever considered these questions before?

If the conditions were right, if the soil was fertile…what would you become?

Nature is a teacher – Just sit quietly under a tree

barryevan

https://natureinmind.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/16-12-23-Tree-Stephens-Green-768x513.jpg

As I sit outside under an old plane tree that I know very well, I get the sense that summer is slowly coming to a close.
A feeling accompanies this realisation.

A sinking, uncomfortable feeling that I know all too well. It is the same feeling that comes on Sunday evenings as another week in the office beckons. The same feeling that comes when the long awaited annual two week holiday is almost over. I remember the exact same feeling a few years ago when I was travelling – I was sitting in a small coffee shop in Bali when I realised that I had passed the half way point of my trip. It hit me hard then. The party would soon be over. The glass was now more empty than full.

This feeling has been with me in one way or another for most of my adult life. Now, as I sit in my favourite place under this old tree I can feel it again. The days are getting shorter and colder. Soon the trees will be bare. I can’t quite put my finger on it but it feels like the sands of time are running out. There is a hollow feeling in my chest.

For years, I would go to great lengths to avoid this feeling. I would busy myself with some mundane task. I would exercise, work, read, meet my friends, text someone… anyone, open a bottle of wine, watch another box set, go for a pint, even meditate or practice yoga. Anything to anesthetise myself and escape this feeling.

No matter what I did the feeling never really went away. It’s always there. I don’t think I’m alone. I think most of us spend our whole lives running from it in one way or another.

As I sit, I can feel the gentle breeze on my skin. I can hear the leaves softly stirring. The blue sky above invites a broader perspective. It’s not all about me. I’m just an insignificant speck in the bigger picture. I am a tiny part of a much bigger whole. The tree I am sitting under has been here for a long time and it will probably still be here long after I’m gone. I feel a softening, a release of tension. I know this place. I feel safe here. I don’t have to run anymore. I don’t have to escape or avoid this feeling. I can just sit here quietly and be with my experience exactly as it is.

What’s wrong?

What is this feeling?

What’s there at the root of it?…

Fear.

A subtle, gnawing fear which is always there in the background. We can spend our whole lives avoiding it. We rarely even acknowledge it.

The sands of time ARE running out. Summer always ends. In a few short months, the leaves overhead that are now green will fall to earth, brown and withered. Even this great plane tree which I am sitting under will someday soon die.

Go deeper.

What else is here?

I sit quietly for a while…

A fear that I when I die I might not have lived my own life. I might not have fulfilled my purpose.

When the plane tree I am sitting under finally dies, it will do so having fulfilled its purpose. It wasn’t supposed to be an oak tree or a beech tree or an ash tree. It was supposed to grow into a plane tree and it will die having done so.

We always think we have more “time”.

Time to change. Time to be true to ourselves. Time to be brave. Time to do what we’ve always wanted to do.

Deep down we might know that we are on the wrong road. There must be more to life than this? We tell ourselves that we still have time.

We wait.

Time marches on. The seasons change. Spring becomes summer, summer becomes autumn and finally autumn becomes winter.

You have only one life. When winter comes, when you are at the end, will you die having been true to yourself? Have you discovered what your gift is and have you used it to the full?

Don’t wait too long.

Earth’s intelligence: Being pulled toward the heart of the world

barryevan

https://natureinmind.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/6-600x400.jpg

How surely gravity’s law,
strong as an ocean current,
takes hold of even the strongest thing
and pulls it toward the heart of the world.

Each thing-
each stone, blossom, child –
is held in place.
Only we, in our arrogance,
push out beyond what we belong to
for some empty freedom.

If we surrendered
to earth’s intelligence
we could rise up rooted, like trees.

Instead we entangle ourselves
in knots of our own making
and struggle, lonely and confused.

So, like children, we begin again
to learn from the things,
because they are in God’s heart;
they have never left him.

This is what the things teach us:
to fall,
patiently trusting our heaviness.
Even a bird has to do that
before he can fly.

-Rainer Maria Rilke, Rilke’s Book of Hours: Love Poems to God
